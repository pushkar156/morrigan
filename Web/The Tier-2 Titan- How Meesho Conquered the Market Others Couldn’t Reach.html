    <h1>Meesho IPO: Navigating the Future of Social Commerce and Value-First E-commerce</h1>

    <h2>Company Overview</h2>
    <p>In the expanding competitive landscape of Indian e-commerce, where industry giants such as Amazon and Flipkart have dominated due to their convenience and reach, <strong>Meesho</strong> emerged as a new alternative in 2015. Founded by Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, Meesho was a peer-to-peer social commerce platform that enabled local individuals, especially women entrepreneurs, to resell their products. This was previously done via WhatsApp and other social media channels, which limited its reach. Meesho provided a one-stop solution to this problem, along with providing affordability and local taste.</p>

    <p>Currently, with over <strong>21 crore annual transacting users</strong>, 575 thousand sellers and a GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) of 6.2 billion, it has positioned itself as a powerful competitor.</p>

    <h2>Structure of the Offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh Issue:</strong> Up to ₹4,250 crores to fund working capital requirements, strategic investments and general corporate purposes. The size may be reduced to ₹850 crores if there is a Pre IPO-placement offer. <small>(Page 133)</small></li>
        <li><strong>Offer for Sale (OFS):</strong> 105,513,839 equity shares to ensure liquidity in the market. Selling shareholders include Elevation Capital, Peak XV Partners and SoftBank, including a portion of the promoter’s stake. <small>(Page 133)</small></li>
        <li><strong>IPO Details:</strong> The company has set a price band of <strong>₹105-₹115 per share</strong>, opening for subscription on December 3rd, valuing the company at $5.6 billion at the end of the IPO. The offering closes on December 5th and is expected to list on December 10th on BSE and NSE.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>Key Financial Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Revenue from operations has surged to ₹9,389.9 crores in FY25, marking a 23% increase from FY24. The company has become cash-flow positive, generating ₹539.37 crore in net operating cash. <small>(Page 409)</small></li>
        <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> The company has incurred losses since its inception. While cash flow positive in FY24 and FY25, restated losses before exceptional items and tax were ₹147.67 crores and ₹108.4 crores for the three months ending June 30 and FY25, respectively. <small>(Page 409)</small></li>
        <li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA:</strong> Increased over the last 3 years, with current data showing a loss of ₹219.59 crores, indicating marginal improvement in core operational efficiency. <small>(Page 409)</small></li>
        <li><strong>Historical Cash Flow:</strong> Consistent negative cash flows from operations over the last 3 years, totalling ₹1,454.863 crores, have reduced the ability to make operational progress. <small>(Page 412)</small></li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>Risks Associated with the Business</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>History of Losses:</strong> Despite operational improvements, the company has incurred losses since 2015, reporting a large loss in FY25. Future profitability depends on successful execution. <small>(Page 87)</small></li>
        <li><strong>High Attrition:</strong> The company has experienced high employee turnover, with attrition rates of 52.04% in FY24 and 33.94% in FY25, indicating potential inefficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Competition:</strong> Meesho faces fierce competition from well-established businesses such as Amazon and Flipkart, placing pressure on pricing and acquisition strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Expenses:</strong> A one-time expense of ₹130 crores was incurred for tax paid on behalf of investors. Logistical expenses have also increased, putting pressure on its platform, Valmo. <small>(Page 450)</small></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Company Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Valmo Logistics:</strong> The development of Meesho’s asset-light logistics platform, Valmo, handles around 62% of orders as of FY25. This involves local partners to lower shipping costs. <small>(Page 91)</small></li>
        <li><strong>Horizon 2 Initiatives:</strong> Management is focused on diversification, including daily essentials and a potential digital financial services platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> A high proportion of orders (76.95% in FY25) are <strong>Cash on Delivery (COD)</strong>, which carries risks related to returns and blocked capital. <small>(Page 93)</small></li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Demergers:</strong> Demerging e-commerce and grocery undertakings into separate entities (Meesho Technologies and Meesho Grocery) aims to increase efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>Market Outlook</h2>
    <p>Professionals have signalled a cautious status on the IPO. The grey market premium (GMP) has surged to ₹35-36 per share, an approximately 32% upside from the price band. At the upper end, the company is valued at 5.6x FY25 revenue, while other firms trade at 1-2x. However, institutions like Kotak Mahindra and JPMorgan have labelled it <strong>“A Logistics Moat Story,”</strong> emphasizing Valmo's role in justifying the premium.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Meesho IPO can be a defining moment for the Indian e-commerce sector. The Horizon 2 initiatives and Valmo are steps toward achieving market leadership. While the company is making strategic investments, achieving positive free cash flow is a breakthrough. The long-term strategy remains clear: develop internal systems to reduce dependency and increase efficiency.</p>
