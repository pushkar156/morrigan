    <h1>PhysicsWallah IPO: From a YouTube Channel to a Billion-Dollar Market Debut</h1>

    <h2>Humble Origins, Vision &amp; Functioning</h2>
    <p><strong>PhysicsWallah (PW)</strong> was founded by Alakh Pandey, a humble start from a YouTube channel, as a physics teacher and science enthusiast from Allahabad, in 2014. His approachable teaching style, emphasis on conceptual understanding, and affordable content have quickly earned him massive student loyalty, as evident from the ~14 million subscribers on his main YouTube channel. In 2020, PW was formally incorporated as PhysicsWallah Pvt. Ltd. and later became PhysicsWallah Ltd. The company’s mission has always been to make quality education affordable and accessible to every aspiring student in India, re-emphasising the fact that education should be a right and not a privilege.</p>

    <p>PW operates on a <strong>hybrid learning model</strong>, integrating digital platforms with physical coaching centres under the “PW Vidyapeeth” brand, which operates across multiple cities in India, including Delhi NCR, Kolkata, Kota, Patna, Bareilly, Jaipur, and Ahmedabad. The platform operates through a combination of recorded lectures, live interactive sessions, and offline classroom teaching.</p>

    

    <h2>Expansion of PW Vidyapeeth and Diversification</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical Footprint:</strong> PW Vidyapeeth (offline coaching centres) has become the foundation of its rapid growth. Between FY24 and FY25, the number of physical centres grew from 182 to 303. These centres now cater to JEE, NEET, and Board exam aspirants, along with newly introduced streams for UPSC, Gate, and state-level exams. With its own app, website, and offline ecosystem, PW has established a pan-India presence that helps bridge the urban-rural divide in education.</li>
        <li><strong>Category Expansion:</strong> Recognising the saturation in the engineering (JEE) and medical preparation segments (NEET), PW has expanded into wider exam domains, including defence (NDA, CDS), government jobs (SSC, Banking, Railways), and civil services, encompassing a total of 19 such categories. Additionally, through subsidiaries such as Utkarsh Classes, iNeuron, and Knowledge Planet, PW has expanded into skill-based learning as well. This diversification positions PW as a comprehensive ‘education conglomerate.’</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recent Financial Performance Snapshot</h2>
    <p>According to the Red-Herring-Prospectus (RHP), PW’s revenue from operations surged from Rs. 7,443.18 million (FY23) to <strong>Rs. 28,866.43 million (FY25)</strong>, implying a 96.9% CAGR. Notably, the revenue split is nearly balanced between digital and physical channels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Online Channel:</strong> 48.64% of total revenue (Rs. 14,040.50 million)</li>
        <li><strong>Offline Channel:</strong> 46.83% of total revenue (Rs. 13,518 million)</li>
    </ul>

    

    <p>The total number of paid users reached <strong>4.5 million</strong>, with an annual growth rate of 59% from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2025. Despite this, the company is in a loss-making position with a net loss of Rs. 2,432.58 million in FY25. Additionally, employee attrition remains a challenge, at around 30%, indicating pressure on faculty retention.</p>

    <h2>The IPO Structure and Key Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Issue Size:</strong> Rs. 3,480 crore (Fresh Issue: Rs. 3,100 crore | OFS: Rs. 380 crore)</li>
        <li><strong>Promoter Exit:</strong> The OFS is by directors Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob.</li>
        <li><strong>Price Band:</strong> Rs. 103 – Rs. 109 per share (Book-building method)</li>
        <li><strong>Lot Size:</strong> 137 shares</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Investment:</strong> Rs. 14,111</li>
        <li><strong>Bidding Dates:</strong> 11th – 13th Nov’25</li>
        <li><strong>Tentative Listing Date:</strong> 18th Nov’25</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use of Funds</h2>
    <p>The Fresh Issue will primarily fuel PW’s next phase of expansion:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Establishment of new hybrid and offline centres under PW Vidyapeeth: <strong>~ Rs. 1,200 Cr</strong></li>
        <li>Lease and rental payments for existing premises: <strong>~ Rs. 600 Cr</strong></li>
        <li>Investment in Technology and platform scalability: <strong>~ Rs. 400 Cr</strong></li>
        <li>Marketing, brand-building, and product diversification: <strong>~ Rs. 300 Cr</strong></li>
        <li>Working capital and general corporate purpose: <strong>~ Rs. 200 Cr</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
    <p>Despite remarkable growth, several risks remain as reported in the RHP (Page No 52-104):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profitability Risks:</strong> Negative net worth (as of March 31, 2024) and negative EBITDA in Fiscal 2024.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand Dependency:</strong> Heavy reliance on the public image and reputation of Alakh Pandey.</li>
        <li><strong>Attrition Rate:</strong> A 30% employee turnover rate poses a threat to content quality and continuity.</li>
        <li><strong>High Valuation:</strong> At Rs. 103 – Rs. 109 per share, the implied valuation of Rs. 28,000 Cr – Rs. 32,000 Cr (~$4 Bn) is considered ambitious for a loss-making phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Operating History:</strong> Relatively limited experience in large-scale offline and hybrid delivery channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Unusual Risk:</strong> Past incidents of faculty being threatened during live sessions could taint the company's reputation.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p><strong>For the Company:</strong> PW’s future is tied to sustaining growth while achieving profitability. Its expansion into new exam categories and skill-based learning gives it a long runway. PW could evolve into India’s most diversified education ecosystem.</p>
    
    <p><strong>For Potential Investors:</strong> This should be viewed as a ‘high risk, high return’ opportunity. Success depends on the institution's execution and cost control. If the company maintains brand authenticity and improves faculty retention, it stands prepared to deliver value over time.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>PhysicsWallah’s IPO represents a bold step for a brand that began from a single YouTube channel. While the valuation may be ambitious, its mission-driven foundation makes it a company to watch for those betting on India’s education revolution.</p>
